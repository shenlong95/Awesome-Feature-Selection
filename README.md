# Awesome-Feature-Selection
Feature selection, or attribute selection, is an effective data pre-processing measure that removes redundant and invalid features, thereby reducing the overhead in machine learning and statistical training while improving training results. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_selection), there are several main advantages of feature selection: simplification of models to make them easier to interpret by researchers/users, shorter training times, to avoid the curse of dimensionality, improve data's compatibility with a learning model class, encode inherent symmetries present in the input space. In practice, feature selection is often used to process high-dimensional data, such as [DNA microarray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_microarray) data.
