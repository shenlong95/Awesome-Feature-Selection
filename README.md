# Awesome-Feature-Selection
Feature selection, or attribute selection, is an effective data pre-processing measure that removes redundant and invalid features, thereby reducing the overhead in machine learning and statistical training while improving training results. According to Wikipedia(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_selection), there are several advantages of feature selection:
1. simplification of models to make them easier to interpret by researchers/users,
2. shorter training times,
3. to avoid the curse of dimensionality,
4. improve data's compatibility with a learning model class,
5. encode inherent symmetries present in the input space.
